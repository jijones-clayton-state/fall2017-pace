			<h1>Church Membership</h1>
			<p>All are welcome to worship with us at Trinity United Methodist Church. We extend an open invitation to participate
				freely in many of the ministries offered here. You do not have to join the church; however, becoming a member of 
				the church provides an opportunity to a committed relationship and deepens one's relationship with the church as 
				one grows in one's faith alongside fellow members in the Body of Christ. Membership in a church is a covenant, 
				a sacred commitment between an individual, the church, and God. Both the church and members make promises to God and to each other.  </p>
			<h3> Members promise to: </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Love, Honor, Obey God</li>
				<li>Live a life of service to God and to others</li>
				<li>Worship through service in this Community</li>
				<li>Grow spiritually through study of Holy Scripture</li>
				<li>Give back to the Church</li>
				<li>Fellowship in brotherly love with others as we seek to evangelize</li>
				<li>And share the gospel of Jesus Christ</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The Church promises to provide: </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Meaningful Worship</li>
				<li>Opportunities for Spiritual Growth</li>
				<li>Opportunities to Give in a Meaningful Way</li>
				<li>Support in Times of Need</li>
				<li>A Place where ALL are Welcome</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Those joining and/or interested in becoming a member of Trinity are asked to attend an orientation course that 
			is offered every third Wednesday and second Sunday monthly and vow before God and this congregation to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Profess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior</li>
				<li>Promise to be a faithful follower of Jesus Christ and to serve Him with your time, talents, and resources</li>
				<li>Promise to participate in the life and mission of this local church family, and work together with us as we
				serve in this community and the world around us</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Vacation Bible School </h3>
			<p> Trinity United Methodist Church's annual Vacation Bible School is a lively program offered for one week 
				each summer for K-12th grade children and adults. The curriculum varies, but a fun time grounded in lessons
				from the Bible is guaranteed. Ask for more information. </p>
			<h3>Confirmation and Bantism Classes for Youth  </h3>
			<p> Confirmation refers to the decision a person makes to respond to God's grace with intentional commitment, 
				publicly reaffirming his or her baptismal vows before the congregation. Most confirmands are youth between the
				ages of 11-13, who have been nurtured in the church since their baptism as infants or young children. During 
				confirmation class, confirmands learn about the meaning of the Christian faith, its history and teachings, 
				The United Methodist Church, and are baptized on Easter Sunday.</p>
			<h1>Bible Study</h1>
			<p>Bible Study is Tuesday's from 7PM â€” 8PM in the church sanctuary for adults and in the classrooms for children.
				The Pastor leads a discussion of the Bible passages that inspire rich dialogue and input from participants.
				From those who have never opened a Bible, to Bible scholars, all are welcome. Usually, a light dinner is
				served after Bible study. Watch the weekly News and Notes and the monthly Church Note on the website
				@ www.trinityvumcstockbridge.org to determine when meals will be served. </p>
			<h1>Prayer Ministry</h1>
			<p>The Prayer Ministry (PM), which began at Trinity United Methodist Church in June 2010, is an outreach ministry
				to church members, friends and acquaintances, as well as to those in need of encouragement and comfort. 
				Members all bring presence, heart and prayer to this ministry, oftentimes discovering their own healing, inner peace, and a
				renewed sense of belonging to a caring community. Meetings are held the First Saturday of each month.
				All are welcomed to join this awesome ministry. </p>
			<h1>Lay Servant Ministry</h1>
			<p>Nearly a dozen members of the congregation make up the corps of lay ministers who have taken
				the Basic and Advanced Lay Speaking courses. They are certified to be used as Sunday morning worship leaders 
				in their local churches and throughout the Griffin District. These volunteers are scheduled on a rotating basis,
				and are each allowed an opportunity to preach once or twice per year.</p>
			<h2>Greeters</h2>
			<p>The friendly folks greeting people on the parking lot and at the sanctuary doors before services represent
				the welcoming spirit of Trinity United Methodist Church. Greeters help to make guests feel welcomed and comfortable
				by offering information regarding Church events and Sunday school if needed, and inviting them to enjoy fellowship
				in the vestibule following worship.</p>
			<h2>Ushers</h2>
			<p>Drawn from the membership at large, ushers of all ages serve during worship and special services as hosts
				to members and guests. They offer an array of services by escorting worshippers to their seats before and
				during service, keeping the gate/ entrance to the sanctuary, receiving the offering, assisting with Holy
				Communion, greeting visitors and caring for them, collecting attendance sheets and tidying the pews. </p>
			<h2>Acolytes</h2>
			<p>"An acolyte is a person who assists the presiding minister/pastor in worship and carries out certain duties,
				including candle lighting; carrying the processional cross; holding or getting items the pastor needs at baptisms,
				Holy Communion, and other worship acts." At Trinity, acolytes light and extinguish the altar candles, which represent
				the Light of Christ Present in the service and the Light of Christ being carried out into the world in the hearts of
				Christian of believers at the end of service.</p>
			<h1 id="B">Boards</h1>
			<h2>Administrative Counsel </h2>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, Administrative Counsel members are committee chairpersons elected to three-year
				terms with exception to certain positions that are held each year, via the annual church nominating/election process.
				With exception to the Pastor Paris Relations (PPR) committee, each committee welcomes volunteers, as well as fresh ideas,
				suggestions and questions. </p>
			<h2> Board of Finance and Administration </h2>
			<p>The Board of Finance and Administration (F&A) is responsible for the church budget, stewardship campaign, investments,
				to accomplish this, the Board has a number of sub-committees, which include house, investment and stewardship. Starting
				in the early spring, F&A works with all of the Board and Committee chairs, as well as the pastor, to draft the church's
				budget for the following year. Subsequently, the draft of the budget is approved by the congregation at the annual Charge
				Conference held each fall. In addition, F&A monitors the church's income and spending throughout the year to make sure, it
				stays within budget. As major unexpected projects come up during the year, such as repairing the roof, F&A decides how to
				fund the project. The Board also researches and finds the best prices for natural gas, electricity and heating oil, and
				negotiates the best possible price on contracted work as necessary. </p>
			<h2>Trustee Board</h2>
			<p>The Board of Trustees is responsible for the upkeep of the church, including building and grounds and any repairs
			deemed necessary. They work hand-in-hand with the pastor, finance committee and Safe Sanctuary Committee to ensure a
			rich worship experience is enhanced by a facility that is warm, safe and inviting.</p>
