		<h1> Trinity United Methodist Church </h1>
		<p> Trinity Methodist Church was organized in 1856 under the leadership of Rev. 0. Ogletree. 
			At its founding, Trinity was part of the Methodist Episcopal Church. For several years, the first place of worship was located in
			"Old Stockbridge," an area that was settled in 1829 when Concord Methodist Church (Present day Stockbridge First United Methodist Church)
			was organized near Old Stagecoach Road. In 1881, the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad were to pass through Stockbridge
			between Macon and Atlanta."The settlers who owned the land round about `Old Stockbridge' asked so much for their land that two prominent
			Atlanta citizens, John W. Grant and George W. Adair, bought a tract about a mile south of Old Stockbridge and offered lots at a reasonable price.
			Here the railroad built their depot and many lots were sold." During the sale of land Rev. Ogletree along with fellow church officers:
			Peter Miller, Jim Ragland, Edward Arnold, Sam Anderson and Rev. Bell acquired land and the first service for Trinity Methodist Church 
			was held just one mile north of "New Stockbridge," Georgia under a Brush Arbor (A tent-like structure made from branches). 
			The Brush Arbor was used for service for many years until a small structure was erected. </p>
		<p> As time passed on the surrounding area grew and Stockbridge was incorporated as a town in 1895 and as a city on August 6, 1920.
			As the boundary lines of city moved from the "Old" to the "New Stockbridge," Trinity was relocated across the railroad tracks northeast
			of the township near the old Hambrick Estate under the leadership of Rev. P. L. Travis. In its early years Trinity Methodist Church grew
			in membership and advanced in its Christian witness under the leaderships of the following pastors: Rev. J. W. Queens, Rev. J. A. Riches,
			Rev. M. M. Austin, Rev. Allison, Rev. Barkley, Rev. W. W. Jones, Rev. A. C. Cobb, Rev. J. W. Swain, Rev. Peigues, Rev. I. C. Rucker, Rev.
			W. M. Bailey, Rev. E. G. Newton, Rev. E. T. Forton, Rev. G. P. Wilson, Rev. E. W. Seacy, Rev. G. Knight, Rev. Mose Marchman and the Rev.
			Freddie Robinson.</p>
		<p> In 1930, a three point Methodist charge was established and Trinity was added to the circuit along with Bentley Hill and Red Oak Methodist
			Churches. At that time, Rev. A.C. Cobb was the Pastor. He served Trinity until 1941 and Rev. G. P. Wilson was appointed as pastor.
			In 1948, the Rev. E. W. Seacy was appointed pastor. The records of the North Georgia Methodist Episcopal Church indicate that Rev.
			Seacy served as senior pastor of Trinity from 1948 to 1955. In 1952, under Rev. Seacy's leadership both he and the current
			membership recognized a need to relocate the church to a new location. As a result, Mr. J. W. Clark donated two acres of
			land located at the corners of 2"4 Street and Wilson Avenue to the church where Trinity is still located to this date. </p>
		<p> "On April 23, 1968, The United Methodist Church was created when Bishop Reuben H. Mueller, representing The Evangelical
			United Brethren Church, and Bishop Lloyd C. Wicke of The Methodist Church joined hands at the constituting General Conference
			in Dallas, Texas. With the words, "Lord of the Church, we are united in Thee, in Thy Church and now in The United Methodist Church,
			" the new denomination was given birth by two churches that had distinguished histories and influential ministries in various parts
			of the world." Across the Nation and abroad many Methodist churches joined ranks with the newly formed United Methodist organization.
			It had approximately 11 million members, making it one of the largest Protestant churches in the world and Trinity Methodist was one
			of them. In May of 1968, Trinity's name changed from Trinity Methodist to Trinity United Methodist Church. </p>
		<p> In the 1990's Trinity experienced a large increase in membership while under the pastorate of Rev. F. Hunter. Overall,
			during its 161-year history, dozens more appointed pastors and a host of dedicated and devoted members of Trinity United Methodist Church
			served as faithful Disciples of Jesus Christ. In 2009, Rev. Jacqueline Johnson was appointed as Trinity's first female pastor and is
			the current pastor to date. Under her leadership Trinity UMC continues to witness and share the gospel story to everyone, everywhere
			for the "World is our Parish." We want others to experience the presence of Christ, The Light of the World, The Everlasting Hope and
			The Joy of our Salvation.</p>
